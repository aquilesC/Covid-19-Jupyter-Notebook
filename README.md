Example Jupyter notebook to explore the data of the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.

## Contribute
There are different ways of contributing to the code. If you identify a problem, you can create an [Issue](https://github.com/aquilesC/Covid-19-Jupyter-Notebook/issues) explaining what you found. If you know the solution, or would like to make an improvement to any of it's parts, I encourage you to create a fork of this repository, implement it and then submit a pull request. In this way the authorship of the code will be nicely documented. 

## LICENSE
The code is released under an MIT License. This means you can re use it and re distribute it as you see fit. The data is released with stringent terms and conditions, and thus you should be careful with the usage you make out of it. I consider this repository an example of educational usage of the data.
